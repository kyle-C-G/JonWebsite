# JonUX Creative Website

This repository contains the source code for the updated version of the website I developed for my friend, Jon Capistrano.

Initally created using pure JS, this repository contains a version of the website I made using Next.js in order to help with the maintainability of the code base in case any further changes were needed. This version is not currently in use.

## The original website can be found here:
